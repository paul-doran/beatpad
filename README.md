# beatpad
Made a beat pad using html, css, and javascript. Each pad plays a sound when a certain key is pressed or clicked and will show animation when engaged.
Designed the interface using Figma and the logo using Adobe Illustrator. The design mimicks existing MPDs on the market (i.e. Akai MPD26).
